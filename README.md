# What is a Database?

A database is (1) a collection of data and (2) contains a method for accessing and manipulating that data. In other words, it's a structured set of computerized data with an accessible interface.

A Database Management System is the programme that lets you interface with the data in your database, for example PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle Database, SQLite.

# MySQL vs SQL

SQL (Structrured Query Language) is the language you use to talk to your database.

Working with MySQL is primarily writing SQL.

SQL is the [standard language](https://www.iso.org/standard/63555.html) that multiple database management systems implement.

```SQL
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Age >= 18;
```

What makes database management systems unique are the features they offer, not the language.
